Pickup, Delivery and Installation Vehicle Routing Problem with Crew Allocation

Novel Pickup, Delivery and Installation Vehicle Routing Problem with Crew Allocation using Mixed Integer Linear Programming using ILOG CPLEX solver

Implemented variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem:

1. Travelling Salesman Problem
2. Vehicle Routing Problem
3. Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows
4. Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows, Pickup and Delivery Constraints
5. Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows, Pickup, Delivery and Installation with Crew Allocation Problem

Three Experiments each were performed for the following to test the efficiency new mathematical model implementation:

1. Time windows
2. Crew Skillset
3. Service Time of each Crew
4. Change in the number of products being delivered
5. Crew Number Count of each skill
6. Crew Cost
7. Installation Time by each crew for each product type (eg Air Conditioner, Sofa Set)
8. Product Capacity
9. Number of Products Bought by Customers

The latitude and longitude for the Depot, Customer Locations and Pickup Warehouses was provided as input and the distance matrix between each location was generated. The Time matrix generated was the time taken to travel from one location to another keeping the speed of the vehicle constant.
